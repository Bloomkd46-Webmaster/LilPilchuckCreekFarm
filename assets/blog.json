I did much better than I expected, taking 4th place for judging and 7th place for management. Sunday began with showmanship but I didn't make the cut due to an improper manuever that I later asked some judges about and learned a couple different situations and what to do, so that was a great learning experience.

Their was also up to 85 goats per class, so when only 20 goats can make the cut, it is very difficult to make it. We did however, make the cut in the four-year-old class, taking 6th place.
