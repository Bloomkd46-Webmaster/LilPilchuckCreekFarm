  <p class="text-center">Our hobby farm is home to ADGA Registered Nigerian Dwarfs, German Shepherds and laying hens. Started as a dream to
    carry on dairy farming, our farm has evolved into a 4-H project with the goal of raising show-quality goats. Thanks to wonderful breed
    mentors we have established a solid herd we hope to learn from and build on.</p>
