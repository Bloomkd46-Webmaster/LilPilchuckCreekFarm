      "With Nationals over, I am now siting here writing this on our way back to Oregon for our yearly camping trip. This was my first time going to Nationals and it was a great experience. I started off on Saturday with Junior Judging and Junior management, of which I made the younger class by 13 days. I did much better than I expected, taking 4th place for judging and 7th place for management. Sunday began with showmanship but I didn't make the cut due to an improper manuever that I later asked some judges about and learned a couple different situations and what to do, so that was a great learning experience.

Their was also up to 85 goats per class, so when only 20 goats can make the cut, it is very difficult to make it. We did however, make the cut in the four-year-old class, taking 6th place.
